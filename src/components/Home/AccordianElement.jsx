            ADHD and epilepsy
            <br />
            <br />
            The connection between autism, ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder), and epilepsy is a complex and multifaceted one. Research
            has shown that individuals with autism or ADHD have a higher risk of
            developing epilepsy compared to the general population. Similarly,
            some studies suggest that children with epilepsy might be at an
            increased risk of developing autism or ADHD-like symptoms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Autism, ADHD, and Epilepsy:

            diagnosis and management.
            <br />
            <br />
            Neurological Underpinnings: These conditions share common underlying
            neurological mechanisms, such as disruptions in brain circuitry,
            neurotransmitter imbalances, or genetic factors, which could
            contribute to their co-occurrence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Challenges in Diagnosis: Due to the complexity of symptoms and their
            overlap, diagnosing epilepsy in individuals with autism or ADHD can
            be challenging. Seizures might be mistaken for behavioral
            manifestations characteristic of autism or ADHD, leading to delayed
            or misdiagnosed epilepsy.

            Seizure Detection: Sensors, such as accelerometers or gyroscopes,
            can be incorporated into wearable devices or implanted systems to
            monitor physical movements and detect abnormal patterns indicative
            of seizures. These sensors continuously track changes in movement or
            vital signs, providing real-time data for seizure detection.
            <br />
            <br />
            Data Collection and Analysis: Sensors gather comprehensive data
            related to an individual's physiological parameters, brain activity,
            heart rate, and even environmental factors. This data is collected
            and analyzed through advanced algorithms to identify seizure
            patterns, frequency, and potential triggers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Early Warning Systems: Advanced sensor-based systems aim to predict
            seizures by recognizing pre-seizure physiological changes or
            alterations in behavior. This early warning enables individuals or
            caregivers to take preventive measures, such as administering
            medication or seeking assistance, to mitigate the impact of
            seizures.
            <br />
            <br />
            Remote Monitoring: Sensors facilitate remote monitoring
            capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to access real-time data
            from patients' devices. This feature enables continuous monitoring
            and timely intervention, even when the patient is at home or in
            hospital.
